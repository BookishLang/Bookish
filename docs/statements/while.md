# The `while` statement on Bookish

While statements are used to do something when something is `true` or `false`, or when something is a specific value. They are used to make `loops` in Non-OOP projects, and can be
used to make loops with OOP Projects, however the function would have to be repeated for the loop to take place.

## Example 1 [LOOP 1]

```csharp

int x = 0;

while (x == 0)
{

  print "It's 0!";

}
```

## Example 2 [LOOP 2]

```csharp

while ("x" == "x")
{

  print "It's x!";

}
```

## Example 3 [LOOP 3]

```csharp

while ("x" != "x")
{

  print "It's not x!";

}
```

It's a common way to make `loops`, and can be used to determine whether something is a value or not instead of using an `if statement`.
